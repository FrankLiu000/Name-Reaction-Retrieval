# Name-Reaction-Retrieval
Name Reactions stand a vital position in Organic Chemistry, but the number of Name Reactions is too high to be remembered by each. Furthermore, scientific researchers and students may not want to spend a lot of time searching. This repository aims to collect Name Reactions in easy-to-retrieval ways and build a searching system based on reaction features and reagents.
